None of this is secret knowledge; the value is in having it organized.</p><span id=continue-reading></span><h2 id=what-you-re-preparing-for>What you're preparing for</h2><p>MANGA-style interviews (Meta, Apple, Netflix, Google, Amazon; plus the companies that copy their process) typically have two components: a coding interview and a behavioural interview. This post covers both. It does not cover system design, which is a separate topic and typically relevant for non-junior roles.<p>The coding interview tests your ability to solve algorithmic problems under time pressure. The behavioural interview tests whether you can talk about your past work without making the interviewer regret their career choices.<p>The coding portion dominates preparation time. Most candidates underestimate the behavioural portion, which is a mistake.<p>The whole process is an imperfect measure of engineering ability. But it is the process, and it's learnable. The resources below are enough to get through it.<h2 id=who-can-apply>Who can apply</h2><p>You don't need a CS degree. A STEM background and some evidence that you can code is enough to get your foot in the door. A GitHub profile with personal projects helps, and the bar is lower than you think: Advent of Code solutions, a small bot, some utilities. I got in with a math background and a handful of mediocre repos, for whatever that's worth.<h2 id=your-cv>Your CV</h2><p>CV writing deserves its own post. A few basics: keep it to one page, quantify your impact where possible ("reduced API latency by 40%" rather than "improved performance"; "processed 2M events/day" rather than "built a data pipeline"), and tailor it to the role. Recruiters follow the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veFlfYjRo1Y">F-shaped reading pattern</a>, so front-load the important information. For a more thorough treatment, see <a href=https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/resume/>Tech Interview Handbook's resume section</a>.<p>Write it in LaTeX or Typst, not Word or Google Docs. Structured markup is easier to maintain, produces consistent output, and gives you a source file you can hand to an LLM for editing. On that note: dump everything you can think of into an LLM, relevant or not (past jobs, projects, skills, education, hobbies, whatever), and let it help you draft and iterate. It will help you figure out what's relevant, what isn't, and find the strongest phrasings. You'll still need to edit the output, but it's a good way to get past the blank page.<p>Match the visual presentation to the company you're targeting. A large, established tech company tends toward conservative styling (think conservative: black and grey, serif fonts); a smaller startup or design-forward company gives you more room to experiment.<h2 id=getting-a-referral>Getting a referral</h2><p>Most of these companies have internal referral systems. If a current employee refers you, your application gets more visibility and often moves faster through the pipeline. The good news: employees are generally happy to refer people. Referral bonuses are common, so it's not a one-sided favour. If you know someone at the company, ask. If you don't, LinkedIn works. A cold message explaining what role you're applying for and why has a reasonable success rate.<p>You don't need to know which team you're targeting; job ads are often generic, and any employee can typically refer you regardless of their own team. The worst they can do is not reply.<h2 id=cheatsheets>Cheatsheets</h2><p>Before diving into courses and problem sets, get yourself a couple of reference sheets. These are useful both during study and for last-minute review.<ul><li><a href=https://github.com/TSiege/Tech-Interview-Cheat-Sheet>Tech Interview Cheat Sheet</a>: a summary of the data structures and algorithms you're expected to know. Think of it as the comp sci course you never took: compressed into a README.<li><a href=https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/2122306/python-cheat-sheet-for-leetcode>Python Cheat Sheet for Leetcode</a>: if you're using Python (and you probably should for interviews, given how concise it is), this covers the standard library methods and idioms that come up repeatedly.</ul><p>Neither replaces understanding the material. They're for quick lookup, not for learning from scratch.<h2 id=algorithms-and-data-structures>Algorithms and data structures</h2><p>This is the core of the preparation. You need to be comfortable with the standard data structures (arrays, hash maps, trees, graphs, heaps) and the standard algorithms (sorting, searching, BFS/DFS, dynamic programming, sliding window, two pointers). The goal is pattern recognition: see a problem, identify which technique applies, implement it without fumbling.<h3 id=free-resources>Free resources</h3><p><a href=https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/>Princeton's Algorithms course</a> covers algorithms and data structures from the ground up. The full course is available for free: slides, videos, exercises, programming assignments, and condensed text excerpts. There are also free Coursera MOOCs (<a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1>Part I</a>, <a href=https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part2>Part II</a>). I only used the slides, but there's plenty of material if you want more depth. This is a proper CS course, not interview prep specifically, so it goes deeper than strictly necessary. That's not a bad thing.<p><a href=https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/coding-interview-study-plan/>Tech Interview Handbook</a> provides a structured study plan for the coding interview. The useful part is <a href=https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/grind75/>Grind 75</a>, a curated set of Leetcode problems you can adjust dynamically: specify how many weeks you have and how many hours per week, and it generates a schedule. This is the closest thing to a "just tell me what to do" resource. One caveat: the site recommends paid courses and materials alongside the free content. Skip those. The free plan and problem set are sufficient.<h3 id=paid-resources>Paid resources</h3><p><a href=https://neetcode.io/>NeetCode</a> is a paid platform whose algorithms course is designed specifically for Leetcode-style interviews: it teaches what you need and nothing more. It also has courses for system design and other topics, which become relevant for more senior roles. It's pricey, but it may be the highest ROI investment a student can make in their lifetime. The jobs on the other side of these interviews pay well enough that a course removing a few weeks of friction pays for itself many times over.<h2 id=behavioural-interview>Behavioural interview</h2><p>The behavioural interview is where most engineers do the least preparation and then act surprised when it goes poorly.<p><a href=https://www.techinterviewhandbook.org/behavioral-interview/>Tech Interview Handbook's behavioural section</a> covers the format, common questions, and how to structure your answers. The standard advice applies: use the STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result), prepare 4-5 stories that you can adapt to different questions (past jobs, academic projects, music competitions, creative endeavours, volunteer work. Anything where you drove a result counts), and practice saying them out loud. Reading your answers silently is not the same as speaking them.<p>Many companies publish the principles they evaluate candidates against. Amazon has its Leadership Principles, Meta has its core values, Google has its hiring attributes. Look them up for the company you're interviewing at. Every behavioural question maps to one or more of these, and interviewers are trained to evaluate you against them. This is not subtle; they will often tell you as much.<h2 id=preparing>Preparing</h2><ul><li>Start early. "I'll cram for two weeks" works for some people. For most, it doesn't. Six to eight weeks of consistent practice is more reliable than two weeks of panic. Consistency matters more than volume: solving a problem or two every day goes a long way.<li>Don't memorize solutions. Memorize patterns. If you understand why BFS works for shortest path in an unweighted graph, you can apply it to problems you haven't seen. If you've memorized the solution to "Number of Islands," you can solve exactly one problem.<li>Mock interviews are probably useful. I haven't done them, so I can't say from experience. You can practice with a friend who is also prepping, pay for coaching from current MANGA employees, or use paid mock interview services online.</ul><h2 id=during-the-interview>During the interview</h2><ul><li>Before writing any code, make sure you understand the problem. Ask about edge cases, input constraints, and expected behaviour on empty or degenerate inputs. Interviewers expect this; jumping straight to code is a red flag.<li>Talk through your thinking. Interviewers care about your reasoning process, not just the final solution. A correct answer you can't explain is worth less than a partial solution with clear reasoning.<li>Once you have an approach, start coding. Prototype and iterate. Do not try to solve everything in your head or by talking it out. Code on the screen is easier for the interviewer to follow, which helps them guide you, and it makes the problem clearer to you too.<li>Listen to your interviewer. They want you to pass; they are on your side. If they give you a hint, take it. If they seem to be nudging you away from your current approach, it's because you're missing something or your approach is wrong. Change direction. Coachability matters: an interviewer may prefer a weaker coder who listens and adapts over a stronger one who doesn't.</ul><p>Good luck.</article><nav class=post-navigation><header class=post-navigation-title><h2>Read More Posts</h2><hr></header><div class=post-navigation-buttons><a aria-label="Prev article" href=https://waifod.dev/blog/polymorphism-crtp/ rel=prev> <span aria-hidden=true>[</span>Polymorphism in C++ and Rust: Virtual, Final, and CRTP<span aria-hidden=true>] ></span> </a></div></nav></main><footer class=footer><address class=socials><ul><li><a aria-label="atom feed" title="atom feed" class=social-link href=https://waifod.dev/atom.xml> <svg aria-label="feed icon" role=img><use aria-hidden=true href=https://waifod.dev/images/social_icons/atom.svg#icon /></svg> </a><li><a aria-label=github class=social-link href=https://github.com/waifod rel=me title=github> <svg aria-label="github icon" role=img><use aria-hidden=true href=https://waifod.dev/images/social_icons/github.svg#icon /></svg> </a><li><a aria-label=linkedin class=social-link href=https://www.linkedin.com/in/waifod/ rel=me title=linkedin> <svg aria-label="linkedin icon" role=img><use aria-hidden=true href=https://waifod.dev/images/social_icons/linkedin.svg#icon /></svg> </a><li><a aria-label=email class=social-link href=mailto:waifod@pm.me rel=me title=email> <svg aria-label="email icon" role=img><use aria-hidden=true href=https://waifod.dev/images/social_icons/email.svg#icon /></svg> </a></ul></address><p class=copyright><span>© <time>2026</time> Matteo Durante</span> <span>Powered by <a href=https://www.getzola.org>Zola</a></span> <span>Theme by <a href=https://eyalkalderon.com>ebkalderon</a></span></footer>
