## Welcome

I'm waifod, also known as Matteo Durante - an Italian mathematician and computer nerd who tries to do stuff and get better at it.

On the math side, I'm interested in homotopical mathematics - particularly higher category theory, algebraic topology, and type theory. On the software side, I care about systems programming, performance, and understanding how things work under the hood.

Besides technical challenges, I enjoy Latino dances, weightlifting, reading, anime and lots of other things.

Here is my [CV](/cv.pdf).
